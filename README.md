# Indiecator  

</div>

This project aims to create a comprehensive, easy-to-use Python toolkit implementing a wide array of technical and quantitative trading indicators. Designed for quantitative researchers, traders, and analysts, the toolkit facilitates the systematic identification and analysis of market trends, patterns, and signals through robust and reliable indicator computations.
### Goals:
- Comprehensive Coverage: Include diverse indicators ranging from classic moving averages, oscillators, and momentum indicators, to more advanced volatility and volume-based measures.
- Accuracy and Efficiency: Ensure precise implementations, optimized for computational speed and memory efficiency, suitable for real-time and historical market analysis.
- Ease of Integration:Provide clean, modular, and well-documented code, allowing users to seamlessly integrate indicators into quantitative strategies, backtesting frameworks, or real-time trading systems.
- Educational Clarity: Clearly document the logic, purpose, and interpretation of each indicator to support educational purposes and facilitate deeper understanding among users.
### Planned Indicator Categories:
- Trend Indicators: Moving Averages (EMA, SMA), MACD, ADX, Parabolic SAR.
- Momentum Indicators: RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R, Rate of Change (ROC).
- Volatility Indicators: Bollinger Bands, ATR, Keltner Channels.
- Volume Indicators: On-Balance Volume (OBV), Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), Money Flow Index.
- Statistical Indicators: Linear regression indicators, Z-Score normalization.
- Advanced Indicators: Ichimoku Cloud, SuperTrend, Volume Profile.
### Technology Stack:
- Python (with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive testing and illustration
- Unit Testing Framework (PyTest) to ensure indicator accuracy and reliability
### Outcome:
Upon completion, this project will deliver a powerful open-source Python library that significantly simplifies the application of trading indicators in quantitative analysis, strategy development, backtesting, and algorithmic trading workflows.
